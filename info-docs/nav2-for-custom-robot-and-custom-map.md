# RECAP: Transforms (TFs) needed for Nav2
1. `map --> odom`
2. `odom --> base_link` (via `base_footprint`)
3. `base_link --> base_scan`

> **Reference**: ["Key TFs needed for Nav2", _Nav2 Stack Overview_](./nav2-stack-overview.md#key-tfs-needed-for-nav2)

# REQUIREMENT 1: Robot model
**Robot modelling method**: Universal Robot Description File (URDF)

- Description of all elements in a robot
- Used by other packages to control/visualise robot accurately
- Given in XML format

**NOTE**: _URDF is a key input to enabling creation of TFs._

---

**NOTE**:

For many applications, implementing TFs is not necessary, because:

_ROS 2 packages may exist that use URDF to create TFs._

---

```
/joint_states --> robot_state_publisher --> /tf --> ...
                           ^
                           |
                          URDF
```

**NOTE**: _`robot_state_publisher` computes and publishes TFs._

# REQUIREMENT 2: Input/output
- Odometry (input to planner)
- Sensors (input to odometry)
- Controller (output to motors)

## Odometry via multiple sensors
```
WEn --> /odom --+                         +--> /odometry
IMU --> /Imu  --+--> robot_localization --+
... --> /...  --+                         +--> odom->base_link
```

**NOTE**:

- `WEn`: Wheel encoder
- `IMU`: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- `/odometry`: Is a topic
- `odom->base_link`: Is a TF

---

Minimum setup for navigation:

- Wheel encoder
- LiDAR (topic: `/scan`, message: `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan`)

---

**NOTE**: ROS 2 package exist to...

- process
- publish

... data from sensors compatible with ROS 2.

## Hardware controller
- Subscribes to `/cmd_vel` topic
- Uses message: [`geometry_msgs/Twist`](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.html); breaks velocity into:
    - Linear velocity
    - Angular velocity
- Actuates motors accordingly

# General steps
> **Further detail**: [_SLAM and Navigation Steps for Any Robot_, `procedure-outlines`](./procedure-outlines/slam-and-navigation-steps-for-any-robot.pdf)

---

**1. Run the [stack](./definitions.md#stack) for the robot**:

_Initialising a robot you can control_...

  - Run robot-specific nodes <br> E.g.: _Sensor fusion, motor actuation, etc._
  - Start publishing required data on appropriate topics <br> E.g.: _Sensor data (e.g. laser scan), odometry, etc._
  - **NOTE 1**: By itself, this does not involve SLAM/navigation
  - **NOTE 2**: The stack can be for physical robot or simulation

E.g.: Using Turtlebot3 (but you can use any robot stack):

`ros2 launch turtlebox_gazebo ...`

Replace `...` with launch file for desired simulated environment.

**Turtlebot3-specific requirement**:

Specify the desired Turtlebot3 URDF model to be used:

This is done by exporting the environment variable `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` as follows:

```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=... # replace ... with a valid URDF model name, e.g. "waffle"
```

Not doing this leads to the following exception when launching Turtlebot3 Gazebo simulations:

```
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): 'TURTLEBOT3_MODEL'
```

**NOTE**: *Place this command in `~/.bashrc` to ensure this variable is exported for every terminal session.*

**KEY POINT**:

- To allow for SLAM and obstacle avoidance, ensure: <br> `LaserScan` message is being piublished in the `/scan` topic

---

**2. Launch the Navigation2 stack**:

CASE 1: _If you intend to operate SLAM_...

`ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py`

Optional arguments:

- `use_sim_time:=True` (if using simulation)

CASE 2: _If you do not intend to operate SLAM_...

`ros2 launch nav2_bringup bringup_launch.py`

Optional arguments:

- `use_sim_time:=True` (if using simulation)
- `map:=...` (if using generated map; replace `...` with path) <br> **NOTE**: _Reference the generated map's YAML file_

**KEY POINT**: *Ensure the map path given in the YAML file matches the map path from the current working directory from which the launch is run. You can also ensure the map path given in the YAML file is an absolute path, to avoid issues that may arise with relative path.*

---

(Optional: If you intend to operate SLAM)

**3. Launch SLAM toolbox**:

`ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py`

Optional arguments:

- `use_sim_time:=True` (if using simulation)

---

**4. Run RViz2 for visualisation and GUI-based inputs**:

`ros2 run rviz2 rviz2`

Within the RViz window, select the necessary parameters to display:

- Map (ensure also to set its topic field as `/map`)\* <br> _This topic only runs upon launching Navigation2_
- TF (transforms; allows visualising different robot frames)
- LaserScan
- RobotModel (NON-ESSENTIAL; allows viewing robot model) <br> _To enable the model_...
    - Set "Description Source" field to "Topic"
    - Set "Description Topic" field to `/robot_description`

If operating only navigation and not SLAM, get costmaps as follows:

- Add another "Map" section; select the topic as `/global_costmap`
- Add another "Map" section; select the topic as `/local_costmap`

**NOTE**: _Subscribe to the respective topics in above sections._

\* _In case of `WARNING: No map received`_...

- Go the the "Durability" field in the "Map" parameter section
- Change the value from "Volatile" to "Transient Local"
