- Saving world model
- Creating a custom Turtlebot3 workspace\*
- Adding required files in custom Turtlebot3 workspace

\* _To add new source files to launch custom world._

# Creating a custom Turtlebot3 workspace
We need to add and build custom programs and files for:

- Custom world model
- Launch file for starting Turtlebot3 in the custom world

---

Now, we cannot edit ROS 2 Humble installations; they are read-only.

---

Hence, we must do the following...

---

**1. Create a ROS workspace for the custom Turtlebot3 build**:

E.g.: `~/my_turtlebot3_workspace`

In this workspace directory, define the `src` directory:

`~/my_turtlebot3_workspace/src`

This is where the source code will go.

---

**2. Clone the Turtlebot3 simulations GitHub repository**:

Link: [`github.com`/`ROBOTIS-GIT`/`turtlebot3_simulations`](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations) 

You must clone it in the `src` directory defined above.

An easy way to do this is navigate to `src` and do:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations .
```

**NOTE**: _The final dot refers to the current directory `src`._

**IMPORTANT SUB-STEP**:

The `turtlebot3_simulations` repo does not have all the dependencies needed by Turtlebot3 simulation packages, e.g. ROS 2 Gazebo-related packages to help run robotics simulations. Not having these dependencies means the custom Turtlebot3 simulation packages cannot be built due to compilation errors (due to missing dependencies). To ensure that these dependencies are available, first obtain the binary installations of Turtlebot3-related packages compatible with the ROS 2 distribution being used; in my case, as I am using ROS 2 Humble, this step looks like:

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlebot3* # * means all packages with names starting with "ros-humble-turtlebot3" must be installed
```

This step automatically installs the necessary dependencies.

*Make sure to source this installation; doing so is not needed if you are already sourcing your binary ROS 2 installations.*

---

**3. Switch the the `humble` branch**:

(_Assuming our ROS 2 distribution is Humble_)

Within `src`, do:

```
git checkout humble
```

This switches the repository branch from `main` to `humble`.

***Why is it necessary?***

- To ensure source files are compatible with ROS 2 Humble
- To ensure already-installed ROS 2 Humble binary installations can be used as dependencies

*Not doing this could lead to compilation errors.*

---

**4. Add custom files/source code where necessary**:

See ["Adding required files in custom Turtlebot3 workspace"](#adding-required-files-in-custom-turtlebot3-workspace).

---

**5. Build packages from `src`**:

In `~/my_turtlebot3_workspace`, run:

```
colcon build
```

This builds the packages defined in `src`.

> **For more on ROS build system**: [_Build System_](./build-system.md)

---

**6. Source the installation setup script for the build**:

<u>OPTION 1</u>: Source in current terminal session:

```
source ~/my_turtlebot3_workspace/install/setup.bash
```

Overlays existing Turtlebot3 installation in current session.

<u>OPTION 2</u>: Source in `.bashrc`:

- Open `.bashrc` using `gedit ~/.bashrc` <br> _Or any other text editor other than `gedit`, e.g. `nano`_
- Below the source command for ROS 2 installation, add: <br> `source ~/my_turtlebot3_workspace/install/setup.bash`
    - Overrides existing Turtlebot3 installation in current session
    - Hence, we enable the use of our custom Turtlebot3 build
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply changes in current session <br> _For new sessions, this file is automatically sourced_

> **For more on source command in Linux**: [_Source Command in Linux_](./source-command-in-linux.md)

---

**7. Specify the desired Turtlebot3 URDF model to be used**:

This is done by exporting the environment variable `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` as follows:

```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=... # replace ... with a valid URDF model name, e.g. "waffle"
```

Not doing this leads to the following exception when launching Turtlebot3 Gazebo simulations:

```
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): 'TURTLEBOT3_MODEL'
```

**NOTE**: *Place this command in `~/.bashrc` to ensure this variable is exported for every terminal session.*

# Adding required files in custom Turtlebot3 workspace
**NOTE**: _Do this before building the custom Turtlebot3 packages._

**1. Add the custom world model in**:

```
~/my_turtlebot3_workspace/src/turtlebot3_gazebo/worlds/
```

**NOTE 1**: The world model is as follows:

- `.world` extension
- Essentially an XML file
- Any valid file name will do

**NOTE 2**: Ensuring the above is recognised as an XML file:

- Open the file's contents
- Check if the XML version specification tag is present at the top <br> E.g.: `<?xml version "1.0"?>`
- If not, add it; this ensures proper parsing within an IDE <br> *Helps with debugging, modification and code review*

---

**2. Add world launch file in**:

```
~/my_turtlebot3_workspace/src/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch/
```

**NOTE**: This launch file is as follows:

- Python source file (`.py` extension)
- Generates world and spawns robot model in Gazebo simulation

**EXAMPLE**:

```python
